### README Generator

### Description

This project features a README generator that a developer can use to generate a READMDE.md file based on user input from the terminal. The objective of this application is to help developers generate a README in a timely manner. The user is prompted to answer a series of questions that will ultimately generate the final file.

This application utilizes node.js, inquires, fs, and an index.js file that holds the code that contains the questions to ask users and to populate their answers.

There is a demo folder in this application. This is where the README-demo.md file will be created (this is the file created once the user answers all the questions prompted).

### Installation

The code for the Responsive Portfolio can be found on github using the following link: https://github.com/shelbyandersen/README-generator

### Usage

The README generator has an index.js file, in addition to using node.js, inquirer, and fs.
